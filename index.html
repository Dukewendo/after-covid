    <br>Feel the thrill of piloting a light aircraft then sit back and observe as somebody else takes
     the controls in this Land Away Double Flying Lesson.
     <br> You’ll have the chance to experience two kinds
      of flying lesson in this unique adventure that allows you to act as pilot on one leg of the journey
       and as an observer on the second leg.
       You’ll land and take off from different locations, subject to the airfield and weather conditions,
       taking it in turns with one other person to pilot the plane, and any time spent behind the controls
        will count towards a Private Pilot’s licence. Once you have completed both flight legs, you will be
         presented with a certificate confirming completion – the perfect memento for an extraordinary
          experience.

  <div class="picText"><h1>Paintballing experience</h1>
    <br>Have you tried paintballing? This combat sport requires teamwork and skill to defeat your opposition.
     It’s an adrenaline filled game of stealth and strategy where the objective is to eliminate the enemy.
       It will feel like real warfare as you work together to hunt them down and take them out before they
        can do the same to you.
    Paintballs will fly and you will have to run, dodge and hide in the undergrowth to escape. Play well 
    and they will never spot you. If you get hit, you’re out, but never fear there will be up to ten 
    scenarios, which reset each time, for you to test your aim and skill as you start a new battle. 
    Paintballing requires you to use all your senses and keep your nerves in check; a steady hand hits
     the target. Will you go it alone like Rambo or work with your friends to ensure victory for you all?

  <div class="picText"><h1>Zombie escape experience</h1>
    Step into the shoes of a horror movie character with this Zombie Apocalypse Experience in 
    Greater Manchester or West Yorkshire.

There are two stories to get involved with here, either at ground zero of the zombie outbreak 
at The Labs or a few months after an escape of the undead to The Mill nearby. Whichever event 
you choose you’ll be in for 2 hours 30 minutes of terrifying action. Be warned, this is a full 
hands-on experience, so if you’re not keeping an eye out you might get dragged off into the 
darkness by scores of hungry zombies.

You’ll be fully trained in all the necessary weaponry and tactics, including a shotgun that
 can fire projectiles at over 350 feet per second. The only thing that stands between zombies 
 and the end of the world is you.

  <div class="picText"><h1>Zorbing experience</h1>
    Have you tried zorbing? It’s the funniest way to get down a hill, inside a giant 
    inflatable ball designed to turn your world upside down. You’ll hurtle down a purpose-built
     run at speeds of over 20mph.

Harness Zorbing is the conventional way to ride one of these balls, which have been specially
 designed to create a comfortable and supportive environment for your ride. Soft PVC pads and
  harnessing ensure you are protected from any lumps and bumps. But don't get too comfortable
   - once you start the rolling you’ll be in for the ride of your life.

Fancy something more extreme? Choose Hydro Zorbing. Forget the harness and add 40 litres of 
water into your zorb and you’ve got yourself a wild water ride for two. Ever wondered what
 it’s like inside a washing machine? Hydro Zorbing is the closest you’ll ever come to finding out. 
 Take your pick!
